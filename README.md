Running:

The player can move around the 2D array map without the ability to go outside the array boundries.
The player has a health bar that can be damaged by an enemy if they do not have the sword item.
I have a sword and key item that the player picks up at specific locations just using bools.
The only way out of the while loop is to get to the escape location (2,2), or by dying.

Not Working:

The main problem I'm facing is that the restrictions in place for movement do not work.
The player can't move outside the map boundries, but they can go anywhere inside the map by typing: up, down, left, right
